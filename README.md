# portfolio
a portfolio website
 The goal of this project is to develop a web application, that provides a framework for portfolio building, that allows customers (students for now) to customize their own portfolio, update it as they will, and that also provides a short link that could be shared with potential recruiters. A userâ€™s account would probably contain information such as their personal information, resume, work experiences, and  job interests. There will also be a notification system that finds a set of jobs or opportunities that a user might be interested in, and alerts the users of those useful information. Users should also be able to view and print a pdf of their profile from the application.
